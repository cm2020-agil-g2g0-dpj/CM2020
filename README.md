Final project

The aim of the project is to create a project lifecycle management linker application that allows product modeling to be combined with part-specific data along with product management and communication functionalities. Most PLM software solutions in the market handle this part complexly and inadequately. Most engineered products are complex, many people are involved to design and develop them, a lot of related data needs to be collected, stored and analyzed. There will be changes that arise from different departments over time. And the application will manage the change requests. The application allows quick action from multi-function workflows and collaborates well with the users.

MVP1 Scope
->Implement a database to provide context for specific drawings (for instance, tied parts, inventory information, physical characteristics of parts, part replacement counts, issues notes, last change).
->Implement aggregation of data (provide aggregation functionality for related parts).
->Implement User Interface
