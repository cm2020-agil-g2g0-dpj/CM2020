# 2.404 Teamwork activity: icebreaker

In your team, give a one-sentence description of a project you would be interested in pursuing. Then, for each point, tell your team members in one sentence: 

1. why your proposed solution is unique 

2. where it might sit in a crowded marketplace of other technologies

3. is the unique selling point really unique and, if so, why havenâ€™t others joined the lucrative market?

Reflect on these ideas as a group. You might find that one of the ideas stands out as an interesting project or that you want to use an amalgamation of ideas to form a new project entirely.
